# SAADAA-Insightful-Data-Exploration
Project Overview:

This repository contains the solution to a Data Science assessment for SAADAA, which involves analyzing a dataset of customer transactions, marketing engagement, product details, and returns. The objective is to explore the data, identify patterns and trends, and provide actionable insights that can help optimize revenue, enhance customer retention, and improve marketing strategies.

Key Objectives:

Customer Behavior Analysis: Explore customer purchasing patterns, frequency of orders, and customer lifetime value.
Sales Performance: Identify best-selling products, revenue drivers, and seasonal trends.
Marketing Effectiveness: Evaluate the impact of marketing channels (Instagram, Google Ads, etc.) on conversion rates.
Return Analysis: Investigate the relationship between discounts, product categories, and return rates.
Inventory Insights: Assess stockout risks and create predictive models for inventory management.
